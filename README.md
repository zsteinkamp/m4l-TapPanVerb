# m4l-TapPanZeit

This is an audio effect made in Max For Live that implements a bucket-brigade multitap (up to 128 individual taps) delay effect with visual control over inter-tap timing and pan position. It can serve as a simple delay, or incredibly complicated combination of the two.

I originally had an idea that there should be a function in a reverb that lets you control the pan position of the reverb tail at specific times after the initial impulse. I didn't find that in the reverbs that I had, so I decided to mock one up. My first attempt was to use an audio effect rack with five chains spread across the stereo range. Each chain had a delay followed by a reverb. The chain delay increased in some increment across the chains, e.g. chain 1 was 0ms delay, chain 2 was 100ms, chain 3 was 200ms, etc. This had the effect of making "reverb bursts" across the stereo field, which was cool. But it wasn't what I had in mind exactly.

One thing led to another and I embraced my love for delays with this concept of controlling a tail. There is a configurable number of taps (up to 128) that are spaced at a configurable time interval. There are visual controls for pan position, volume, and time coefficient that give you very direct control over some wild effects.

## Usage

### Taps
This knob controls how many taps are in the tap field.

### Time Base
This knob controls the default delay between each tap in the field.

### Tap Time Factor
This is a visual input to control each tap's relative delay time. Pull the line toward zero to speed up the taps, or up to one to slow it back down. Shift-click to remove points. Alt-drag to adjust curve.

### Panning Path
This is a visual control that lets you position each tap in stereo space.  Draw a line to indicate where, from left to right, each tap should be placed. Shift-click to remove points. Alt-drag to adjust curve.

### Tap Output Volume
This controls the output of each tap, so you can make the taps fade in or out or anything in between. Shift-click to remove points. Alt-drag to adjust curve.

### Dry Volume
This knob controls how much of the original input signal is sent to the device output.

### Wet Volume
This knob controls how much of the tap output signal is sent to the device output.

### Feedback Amount
This knob controls how much of the output signal is fed back into the pre-reverb section.
